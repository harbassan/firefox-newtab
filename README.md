## firefox new tab
custom new tab for firefox that shows bookmarks (organised in folders) and has some useful keyboard shortcuts.

alters the ui slightly when using brave's built in search [bangs](https://search.brave.com/bangs).

shortcuts are: 
- `/` [focus into searchbar]
- `!` [focus into searchbar and start a bang]
- `.` [open all in current folder] 
- `<sc>` [open from current folder] 
- `;<sc>` [switch folder] 
- ` <sc>` [open from all folders]
- `Esc` [clear all input and unfocus all]


needs a .env with key FIREFOX_PF_PATH for getting bookmark info and NEWS_API_KEY for the headlines, via https://newsapi.org/.
