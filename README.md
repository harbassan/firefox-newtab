custom new tab for firefox that shows bookmarks (organised in folders) and has some useful keyboard shortcuts.

shortcuts are: 
- `.` [open all in current folder] 
- `;<sc>` [switch folder] 
- `<sc>` [open from current folder] 
- ` <sc>` [open from all folders]

needs a .env with key FIREFOX_PF_PATH for bookmark info and NEWS_API_KEY for the headlines, via https://newsapi.org/.
